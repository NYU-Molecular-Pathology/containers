# Software Containers

This repository contains [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) and [Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/2.5/user-guide/quick_start.html) recipes to build software containers for use with sequencing and data analysis.

- NOTE: These instructions are designed to be used from a Mac computer with admin access. They should also work on Linux systems but many methods will be unnecessary on Linux.

# Usage

First, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/NYU-Molecular-Pathology/containers.git
cd containers
```

The included `Makefile` contains the commands needed to build and test containers in this repository.

It is recommended to build containers one at a time, and test each one after building.

## Singularity

Singularity containers are meant to be used on HPC, where Docker is not allowed. Singularity containers must be built on a system to which you have root (admin) access e.g. your desktop computer. Singularity itself can only be run natively in a Linux environment. To build a Singularity container from your Mac desktop, you need either Vagrant or Docker installed, in which to run Singularity via a Linux virtual machine/container (included). Instructions for building Singularity containers using both are included. Recipes to create Singularity containers are saved in files named `Singularity` or `Singularity.image-tag-name`, such as `Singularity.GATK-3.8`. The output will consist of an image file (`.simg`), which must be transferred to your target system for use.

### Build Singularity containers with Vagrant

Vagrant needs to be installed on your Mac (see installation instructions in the included file `VAGRANT.md`). The file `Vagrantfile` included in this repository provides the definitions for the virtual machines to be used for building and testing Singularity containers.

#### Build

To build a Singularity container using Vagrant, run a command such as the following:

```
make singularity-build VAR=<dirname>
```

Where `VAR` is the name of the directory in this repository that contains the recipe for the Singularity container you wish to build. For example:

```
make singularity-build VAR=sambamba-0.6.6
```

- NOTE: If your builds start failing randomly or you start getting strange errors inside your containers, try removing the reference to your Vagrant VM (`make clean-vagrant`) and try again. Be sure to remove old Vagrant VM's from VirtualBox if you do this.

- NOTE: Some Singularity recipes that pull from Docker images tend to fail when building with Vagrant, try building with the Docker container as described further below.

#### Test

To test a Singularity container that you have built, you can use the following command:

```
make singularity-test VAR=<dirname>
```

This will load an interactive shell session inside the target container, where you can verify that your software is present and operational.

### Build Singularity containers with Docker

You can build Singularity containers using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/). First, you need to build a Docker container that contains Singularity:

```
make docker-build VAR=Singularity-2.4
```

#### Build

You can build a Singularity container using Docker with the following command:

```
make singularity-build-docker VAR=<dirname>
```

You can adjust the container tag using the `DOCKERREPO` ('stevekm/containers') or `DOCKERTAG` ('stevekm/containers:container-name') Makefile variables.

### Sync

To copy a Singularity container to your target system, you can generate a template `rsync` command with:

```
make singularity-sync VAR=<dirname>
```

This will print out a template command to transfer your container file via `rsync` & ssh to your target system. For example:

```
$ make singularity-sync VAR=sambamba-0.6.6
command:
rsync --dry-run -vrhP -e ssh sambamba-0.6.6/sambamba-0.6.6.simg kellys04@bigpurple.nyumc.org:/gpfs/home/kellys04/containers/
```

You can specify the username, server address, and server destination path with `Makefile` variables like this:

```
$ make singularity-sync VAR=sambamba-0.6.6 USER=bob REMOTE=some.server.com REMOTEDIR=/path/to/containers/
command:
rsync --dry-run -vrhP -e ssh sambamba-0.6.6/sambamba-0.6.6.simg bob@some.server.com:/path/to/containers/
```

You will want to copy & paste this to run this with `--dry-run` as shown first, then run again without it when you are sure the transfer looks correct.

# Docker Containers

The following Docker containers are included for special purposes:

- `Singularity-2.4`: used to build Singularity containers

- `Miniconda3-4.4.10`: used as a scratch-pad test container to interactively determine compatible versions of `conda` libraries for installation in other containers

## Build

Docker containers can be built with the following command:

```
make docker-build VAR=<dirname>
```

## Test

Docker containers can be tested with the following command:

```
make docker-test VAR=<dirname>
```

This will start an interactive shell in the container, where you can verify that your software works.
